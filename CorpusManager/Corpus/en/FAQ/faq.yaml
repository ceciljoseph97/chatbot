  - - "I cannot access periNodes and periMICA containers in the Chrome browser under Linux. Is there a solution for this?"
    - |
      Unfortunately, Chrome does not support IPv6 link-local addresses under Linux. Please use Firefox. Also, make sure that the module mdns6 or mdns6_minimal has been entered in your /etc/nsswitch.conf.
  - - "Do you also have Tenant access to view the devices in the application in the cloud? (Starter Kit Plus)"
    - |
      We do not yet have online access for presentation purposes. The development effort is not small, but it is feasible. A "Starter Kit Plus video" is planned to show the functionality online.
  - - "How can I ping IPv4 servers in the periMICA container?"
    - |
      You can use NAT64 addresses by adding the prefix 64:ff9b:: to the IPv4 address.
      Example: ping 64:ff9b::192.0.2.1
  - - "I have an IPv4-only network and can connect to the periMICA, but not the periMICA containers."
    - |
      Please enable the domain forwarding feature in the network settings of periMICA.
  - - "How do I connect the wires of the M12 Cable Assembly A-cod 4 pole straight female 1.0m (MICA) to 24V DC or GROUND? Where can I find this information?"
    - |
      Red/blue = GND, yellow/pink = 24V DC. The information is in the periMICA User Guide on page 13.
      Addition: It should be included in the periMICA Quick Start Guide.
  - - "Which communication medium should I use for Perinet products, HTTP or MQTT? Why is that important?"
    - |
      We recommend MQTT for data transfer and HTTP for configuration purposes. HTTP is synchronous communication, while MQTT is asynchronous communication.
      - HTTP (synchronous): Like a phone call, it requires both sides to communicate at the same time, ideal for configuration and settings that require immediate response or confirmation.
      - MQTT (asynchronous): Like email, a message is sent and the recipient can retrieve it later, making it useful for transmitting data from sensors without requiring constant connectivity.
      By combining both methods, you utilize the strengths of each technology.
  - - "How can I change a public network to private if I can't do this via the Windows interface?"
    - |
      Use the command line tool: set-netconnectionprofile -name "network name" -network category private.
  - - "I accidentally selected the wrong certificate when accessing the website of a secure periMICA Container / Smart Component. Now I get an error and cannot decide again. What should I do?"
    - |
      Depending on your browser, there are different ways to solve this problem:
      - In Chrome: Right click, choose "Inspect". In the Dev Tools menu, find the "Application" tab, make sure "Storage" is selected, and click "Clear site data".
      - In Safari: Go to Safari > Preferences > Privacy. Search for your website, click it, and click "Remove".
      - In Firefox: Click the lock icon next to the URL bar. Choose "Clear Cookies and Site Data" and make sure to select your site only, then click "Remove".
  - - "My periMICA password cannot be saved in the Chrome browser."
    - |
      Saving passwords is disabled by default for self-signed certificates. It can be enabled with the option chrome://flags/#allow-insecure-localhost. Caution: this option applies to all websites.
  - - "I am in a new network and periNODEs cannot be called up via Edge or Chrome browser, but they communicate with each other and I can reach my periMICA."
    - |
      Try Firefox. Chrome-based browsers require a global IPv6 address to resolve link-local names to IPv6 link-local addresses. Firefox does not have this issue.
  - - "When trying to add any Perinet device to the periMICA home site (via Settings/Remote Devices), an error occurs: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'split.'"
    - |
      If periMICA is set to DHCP, you cannot add a remote device. First, set periMICA to a static IPv4 address and give it an address (e.g., 192.168.0.1). Afterward, you can set it back to DHCP and add remote devices.
  - - "With curl version > 8.7.x, libperiCORE based firmware cannot be updated anymore. The PUT request fails. What should I do?"
    - |
      Use an older version of curl to resolve this issue.
